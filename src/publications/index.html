      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Machine learning on encrypted data is an emerging field that
        can be used for a variety of real-world applications. A
        particular application might be where a user has an idea for
        an innovative technology, and would like to confidentially
        submit their idea to an external platform that can
        semantically analyze their idea and return whether this idea
        has already been patented, without anyone other than the user
        being privy to her idea. The generalization of such a
        construction would be when a user wishes to make a private
        query to a public or third-party dataset, while maintaining
        the confidentiality of their query. In this paper, we make use
        of somewhat-homomorphic privacy- preserving building blocks
        for machine learning to enable this type of analysis, while
        extending and optimizing known theoretical constructions.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Silent Text, the instant messaging application by the company
        Silent Circle, provides its users with end-to-end encrypted
        communication on the Blackphone and other smartphones. The
        underlying protocol, SCimp, has received many extensions
        during the update to version 2, but has not been subjected to
        critical review from the cryptographic community. In this
        paper, we analyze both the design and implementation of SCimp
        by inspection of the documentation (to the extent it exists)
        and code. Many of the security properties of SCimp version 1
        are found to be secure, however many of the extensions contain
        vulnerabilities and the implementation contains bugs that
        affect the overall security. These problems were fed back to
        the SCimp maintainers and some bugs were fixed in the code
        base. In September 2015, Silent Circle replaced SCimp with a
        new protocol based on the Signal Protocol.

        The OMEMO protocol is a Jabber/XMPP implementation of the
        Signal protocol.  The report contains the analysis the
        cryptographic properties of the specification and conducts a
        code-review of the reference implementation in the
        Conversations application for Android.

        Silent Text, the instant messaging application by the company

        with the TextSecure protocol in the Silent Phone
        application. In my master thesis, I analyze both the design
        and implementation of SCimp by inspection of the documentation
        and code, and I build a formal model of the protocol using
        Proverif. Many of the security properties provided by the core
        protocol are proven in the formal model, however many of the
        extensions contain vulnerabilities and the implementation
        contains bugs that affect the overall security. A comparison
        between SCimp and TextSecure highlights the improvements that
        the latter has over the former.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        In this thesis I mechanically verify the correctness and
        linear time complexity of the core of the Euclidean Feature
        Transform (EFT) algorithm, using the proof assistant PVS. The
        EFT algorithm computes the EFT function for a data grid of
        arbitrary dimension. The EFT function calculates the set of
        nearest "background" data points, for each data point in the
        grid. The distance between data points is measured by the
        standard Euclidean distance.
