      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) establishes shared ('symmetric')
        cryptographic keys which are essential for secure online communication.
        AKE protocols can be constructed from public-key cryptography like Key
        Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). Another approach is to use Quantum Key
        Distribution (QKD) to establish a symmetric key, which uses quantum
        communication. Combining post-quantum AKE and QKD appropriately may
        provide security against quantum attacks even if only one of the two
        approaches turns out to be secure.

        We provide an extensive review of existing security analyses for
        combined AKE and their formal security models, and identify some gaps
        in their treatment of QKD key IDs. In particular, improper handling of
        QKD key IDs leads to Dependent-Key attacks on AKE.

        As our main conceptual contribution, we model QKD as an oracle that
        closely resembles the standard ETSI 014 QKD interface.  We demonstrate
        the usability of our QKD oracle for cryptographic security analyses by
        integrating it into a prominent security model for AKE, called CK+
        model, thereby obtaining a security model for combined AKE that catches
        Dependent-Key attacks. In this model, we formally prove security of a
        new protocol that combines QKD with a triple-KEM handshake. This is the
        first provably secure hybrid protocol that maintains
        information-theoretic security of QKD.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the distribution of secret keys
        for quantum-secure communication between two distant parties, vital in
        the quantum computing era in order to protect against quantum-enabled
        attackers. However, overcoming rate-distance limits in QKD and the
        establishment of quantum key distribution networks necessitate key
        relaying over trusted nodes. This process may be resource-intensive,
        consuming a substantial share of the scarce QKD key material to
        establish end-to-end secret keys. Hence, an efficient scheme for key
        relaying and the establishment of end-to-end key pools is essential for
        practical and extended quantum-secured networking. In this paper, we
        propose and compare two protocols for managing, storing, and
        distributing secret key material in QKD networks, addressing challenges
        such as the success rate of key requests, key consumption, and overhead
        resulting from relaying. We present an innovative, fully decentralized
        key distribution strategy as an alternative to the traditional
        hop-by-hop relaying via trusted nodes, where three experiments are
        considered to evaluate performance metrics under varying key demand.
        Our results show that the decentralized pre-flooding approach achieves
        higher success rates as application demands increase. This analysis
        highlights the strengths of each approach in enhancing QKD network
        performance, offering valuable insights for developing robust key
        distribution strategies in different scenarios.

        Quantum Key Distribution Networks (QKDNs) enable information-

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is currently being discussed as a
        technology to safeguard communication in a future where quantum
        computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems. In this
        paper, we conduct a comprehensive security evaluation of QKD-based
        solutions, focusing on real-world use cases sourced from academic
        literature and industry reports. We analyze these use cases, assess
        their security and identify the possible advantages of deploying
        QKD-based solutions. We further compare QKD-based solutions with
        Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), the alternative approach to achieving
        security when quantum computers compromise traditional public-key
        cryptosystems, evaluating their respective suitability for each
        scenario. Based on this comparative analysis, we critically discuss and
        comment on which use cases QKD is suited for, considering factors such
        as implementation complexity, scalability, and long-term security. Our
        findings contribute to a better understanding of the role QKD could
        play in future cryptographic infrastructures and offer guidance to
        decision-makers considering the deployment of QKD.

      <p>
        Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks enable connected parties to
        exchange cryptographic keys that are information-theoretically secure.
        In absence of quantum repeaters, key relaying between trusted nodes is
        the foremost method to overcome fundamental rate-distance limitations
        of point-to-point QKD links.  This method requires consumption of keys
        generated by each independent QKD link in the relay path, but these
        resources can be depleted, resulting in failure.  Hence, selecting
        suitable relay paths is essential for enabling successful key exchanges
        between each pair of communicating parties. This paper presents how the
        success rate of key relaying can be increased by frequently recomputing
        relay paths considering the availability of keys, i.e., resource-aware
        routing.  A centralized routing approach is adopted for the key relay
        process, which is emulated to measure and compare the success rates
        achieved by different routing algorithms. It was found that using
        centralized resource-aware routing can increase the success rate up to
        13.4 percentage point compared to selecting the shortest path without
        taking the availability of link keys into account.  However, the
        differences amongst the success rates achieved by different
        resource-aware routing algorithms are statistically insignificant, if
        the centralized routing approach described in this paper is used.
        Therefore, this paper recommends to focus on resource aware routing
        algorithms that are computationally inexpensive and suitable for
        large-scale implementation.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        The assumed computationally difficulty of factoring large integers
        forms the basis of security for RSA public-key cryptography, which
        specifically relies on products of two large primes or semi-primes. The
        best-known factoring algorithms for classical computers run in
        sub-exponential time. Since integer factorization is in NP, one can
        reduce this problem to any NP-hard problem, such as Boolean
        Satisfiability (SAT). While reducing factoring to SAT has proved to be
        useful for studying SAT solvers, attempting to factor large integers
        via such a reduction has not been found to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shor's quantum factoring algorithm factors any integer in polynomial
        time, although large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of
        implementing Shor's algorithm are not yet available, so relevant
        benchmarking experiments for factoring via Shor's algorithm are not yet
        possible. In recent years, however, several authors have attempted
        factorizations with the help of quantum processors via reductions to
        NP-hard problems. While this approach may shed some light on some
        algorithmic approaches for quantum solutions to NP-hard problems, in
        this paper we study and question the practical effectiveness of this
        approach for factoring large numbers. We find no evidence that this is
        a viable path toward factoring large numbers, even for scalable
        fault-tolerant quantum computers, as well as for various quantum
        annealing or other special purpose quantum hardware.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
				Information security deals with the protection of our digital
				infrastructure.  Achieving meaningful real-world security requires
				powerful cryptographic models that can give strong security guarantees
				and it requires accuracy of the model. Substantial engineering effort
				is required to ensure that a deployment meets the requirements imposed
				by the model.
			</p>
			<p>
				Quantum information impacts the field of security in two major ways.
				First, it allows more efficient cryptanalysis of currently widely
				deployed systems. New "post-quantum" cryptographic algorithms are
				designed to be secure against quantum attacks, but do not require
				quantum technology to be implemented. Since post-quantum algorithms
				have different properties, substantial effort is required to integrate
				these in the existing infrastructure. Second, quantum cryptography
				leverages quantum-mechanical properties to build new cryptographic
				systems with potential advantages, however these require a more
				substantial overhaul of the infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this thesis I highlight the necessity of both the mathematical
				rigour and the engineering efforts that go into security protocols in
				the context of quantum information. This is done in three different
				contexts.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, I analyze the impact of key exhaustion attacks against quantum
				key distribution, showing that they can lead to substantial loss of
				security. I also provide two mitigations that thwart such key
				exhaustion attacks by computationally bounded adversaries, without
				compromising the information theoretically secure properties of the
				protocol output. I give various security considerations for secure
				implementation of the mitigations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, I consider how quantum adversaries can successfully attack
				quantum distance bounding protocols that had previously been claimed to
				be secure by informal reasoning. This highlights the need for
				mathematical rigour in the analysis of quantum adversaries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third, I propose a post-quantum replacement for the socialist
				millionaire protocol in secure messaging. The protocol prevents some of
				the usability problems that have been observed in other key
				authentication ceremonies. The post-quantum replacement utilizes
				techniques from private set intersection to build a protocol from
				primitives that have seen much scrutiny from the cryptographic
				community.

      <p>
        A system and method are provided for mitigating key-exhaustion attacks
        in a key exchange protocol. The method includes computationally
        confirming an exchange of key bits has provided fresh shared key
        material before information theoretically confirming the exchange of
        key bits has provided fresh shared key material, while maintaining
        synchronization between messaging parties. In one implementation,
        maintaining synchronization includes updating keys in between each
        post-processing message session and managing a local state of each
        messaging party in the key exchange protocol prior to sending a next
        post-processing message. In another implementation, maintaining
        synchronization includes hiding a message containing the information
        theoretic authenticator by executing a decoy authentication process,
        prior to using an information theoretical key.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        There have been several efforts to apply quantum SAT solving methods to
        factor large integers. While these methods may provide insight into
        quantum SAT solving, to date they have not led to a convincing path to
        integer factorization that is competitive with the best known classical
        method, the Number Field Sieve. Many of the techniques tried involved
        directly encoding multiplication to SAT or an equivalent NP-hard
        problem and looking for satisfying assignments of the variables
        representing the prime factors. The main challenge in these cases is
        that, to compete with the Number Field Sieve, the quantum SAT solver
        would need to be superpolynomially faster than classical SAT solvers.
        In this paper the use of SAT solvers is restricted to a smaller task
        related to factoring: finding smooth numbers, which is an essential
        step of the Number Field Sieve. We present a SAT circuit that can be
        given to quantum SAT solvers such as annealers in order to perform this
        step of factoring. If quantum SAT solvers achieve any asymptotic speedup over
        classical brute-force search, then our factoring algorithm is faster
        than the classical NFS.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Machine learning on encrypted data is an emerging field that
        can be used for a variety of real-world applications. A
        particular application might be where a user has an idea for
        an innovative technology, and would like to confidentially
        submit their idea to an external platform that can
        semantically analyze their idea and return whether this idea
        has already been patented, without anyone other than the user
        being privy to her idea. The generalization of such a
        construction would be when a user wishes to make a private
        query to a public or third-party dataset, while maintaining
        the confidentiality of their query. In this paper, we make use
        of somewhat-homomorphic privacy- preserving building blocks
        for machine learning to enable this type of analysis, while
        extending and optimizing known theoretical constructions.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        Silent Text, the instant messaging application by the company
        Silent Circle, provides its users with end-to-end encrypted
        communication on the Blackphone and other smartphones. The
        underlying protocol, SCimp, has received many extensions
        during the update to version 2, but has not been subjected to
        critical review from the cryptographic community. In this
        paper, we analyze both the design and implementation of SCimp
        by inspection of the documentation (to the extent it exists)
        and code. Many of the security properties of SCimp version 1
        are found to be secure, however many of the extensions contain
        vulnerabilities and the implementation contains bugs that
        affect the overall security. These problems were fed back to
        the SCimp maintainers and some bugs were fixed in the code
        base. In September 2015, Silent Circle replaced SCimp with a
        new protocol based on the Signal Protocol.

      <p>
        Silent Text, the instant messaging application by the company
        Silent Circle, provides its users with secure end-to-end
        encrypted communication on the Blackphone and other
        smartphones. The underlying protocol, SCimp, has received many

        with the TextSecure protocol in the Silent Phone
        application. In my master thesis, I analyze both the design
        and implementation of SCimp by inspection of the documentation
        and code, and I build a formal model of the protocol using
        Proverif. Many of the security properties provided by the core
        protocol are proven in the formal model, however many of the
        extensions contain vulnerabilities and the implementation
        contains bugs that affect the overall security. A comparison
        between SCimp and TextSecure highlights the improvements that
        the latter has over the former.

      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>
        In this thesis I mechanically verify the correctness and
        linear time complexity of the core of the Euclidean Feature
        Transform (EFT) algorithm, using the proof assistant PVS. The
        EFT algorithm computes the EFT function for a data grid of
        arbitrary dimension. The EFT function calculates the set of
        nearest "background" data points, for each data point in the
        grid. The distance between data points is measured by the
        standard Euclidean distance.
