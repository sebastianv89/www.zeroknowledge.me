      <h3>Abstract</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Silent Text, the instant messaging application by the company
      Silent Circle, provides its users with secure end-to-end
      encrypted communication on the Blackphone and other
      smartphones. The underlying protocol, SCimp, has received many
      extensions during the update to version 2, but has not been
      subjected to critical review from the cryptographic
      community. In September 2015, Silent Circle replaced SCimp with
      the TextSecure protocol in the Silent Phone application. In my
      master thesis, I analyze both the design and implementation of
      SCimp by inspection of the documentation and code, and I build a
      formal model of the protocol using Proverif. Many of the
      security properties provided by the core protocol are proven in
      the formal model, however many of the extensions contain
      vulnerabilities and the implementation contains bugs that affect
      the overall security. A comparison between SCimp and TextSecure
      highlights the improvements that the latter has over the former.
