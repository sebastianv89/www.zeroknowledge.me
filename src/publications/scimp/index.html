      <h3>Abstract</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Silent Text, the instant messaging application by the company
      Silent Circle, provides its users with end-to-end encrypted
      communication on the Blackphone and other smartphones. The
      underlying protocol, SCimp, has received many extensions during
      the update to version 2, but has not been subjected to critical
      review from the cryptographic community. In this paper, we
      analyze both the design and implementation of SCimp by
      inspection of the documentation (to the extent it exists) and
      code. Many of the security properties of SCimp version 1 are
      found to be secure, however many of the extensions contain
      vulnerabilities and the implementation contains bugs that affect
      the overall security. These problems were fed back to the SCimp
      maintainers and some bugs were fixed in the code base. In
      September 2015, Silent Circle replaced SCimp with a new protocol
      based on the Signal Protocol.
